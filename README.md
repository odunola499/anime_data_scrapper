# ðŸ¤–An Anime Webscrapper built with Python
### This scrapper retrieves details of top Anime from the [_Animelist_](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php "Animelist") Website


# ðŸ¤ŒBackground

 This is part of a beginner level project i began recently. My goal was to perform analysis on various anime to figure out what distinct feature made a particular anime more popular than others. Data available was not sufficient for my task so i decided to write a webscraper that creates a useful dataset for me. 

# Overview
## The document _anime_scrapper.py_ contains the scrapper
 This code utilises the popular python webscraping libraries Requests and Beautiful Soup. Ensure that you have the libraries in the _requirements.txt_ to run the program well
 after running the program,  a csv file containing the dataset is created in the current directory

# How to use

### To run the program;
```
# number of rows required indicates the number of top animes to be scrapped
animescrape("number of rows required")
```

## Note: Ensure you rename your csv file after you run the program as it could be overwritten

## Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
